# Day 29 - ReactJS Learning ðŸš€

## ðŸ“Œ Topics Covered  

### 1. Simple Validation using useState  
- Implemented basic form validation (username, password, etc.).  
- Good for small forms but can become messy as forms grow.  

### 2. Validation using useAction  
- A cleaner alternative to manage form state.  
- Helps avoid multiple useState declarations.  
- Simplifies validation logic for medium-sized forms.  

### 3. useReducer Hook for Form Handling  
- Explored how useReducer is better for *complex forms*.  
- More structured and scalable compared to useState or useAction.  

### 4. Lazy Loading in React  
- Implemented *lazy loading* to optimize performance.  
- Prevents unnecessary component rendering.  
- Makes the app faster and more efficient.  

### 5. Performance Testing with Lighthouse  
- Used *Lighthouse* to test app speed and performance.  
- Checked *Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, SEO*.  
- Found areas of improvement for app optimization.  

### 6. The use API in React  
- Learned about the new use API (not a hook).  
- Useful for data fetching and handling asynchronous resources.

## âœ¨ Key Takeaways  
- Use useState for *simple forms*.  
- Use useAction for *cleaner state handling* in *medium forms*.  
- Use useReducer for *complex forms*.  
- Always optimize apps with *lazy loading* and test with *Lighthouse*.  
- Explore new features like **use API** for modern React apps.
